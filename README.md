# Salary Prediction Model

## Introduction
This Python script implements a simple linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience. It utilizes the scikit-learn library for model training and matplotlib for visualization.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python salary_prediction.py
   ```
4. Enter the years of experience when prompted.
5. View the predicted salary based on the input.

## Example
Suppose you have the following data:

| Years of Experience | Salary   |
|---------------------|----------|
| 1                   | 20,000   |
| 2                   | 40,000   |
| 3                   | 65,000   |
| 4                   | 95,000   |
| 5                   | 130,000  |
| 6                   | 150,000  |

Running the script and entering `7` years of experience would predict a salary of approximately `$173,309.17`.
